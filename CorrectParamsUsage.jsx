The solution involves restructuring your component hierarchy to ensure that the component using `useParams` is a direct child of a `Route` component. For example, instead of using `useParams` in a deeply nested component far removed from your route definitions, the component that needs route parameters should be rendered directly within the relevant `Route` component.  This ensures that the `useParams` hook has the correct context and access to the current route parameters.
